Smart Home Automation

Imagine you're building a smart home automation system where various devices (lights, thermostat, music player, etc.) can be controlled remotely using a central hub or app. Each device has different functionalities, but you want to create a unified and flexible control mechanism.

Design a system that allows you to control multiple smart home devices with ease. Your goal is to create a solution where:

You can control a variety of devices from a central hub or app, sending commands like "Turn On," "Turn Off," "Increase Temperature," "Decrease Volume," etc.
Each device has unique actions associated with these commands. For example, turning on the lights might involve changing their brightness level, while turning on the music player may involve playing a specific playlist.
New devices can be seamlessly integrated into the system without modifying existing code. You want to ensure that adding a new device doesn't require changes to the central control logic.
Devices can be controlled without the central hub or app needing to understand the internal workings of each device. It should send high-level commands without needing low-level details.
Your challenge is to apply a design pattern that provides a flexible and scalable way to control a variety of smart home devices, ensuring that new devices can be added without disrupting the existing system's functionality.

In your solution you must provide the following in your Github link account:

To design a flexible and scalable smart home automation system that meets the specified requirements, we can utilize the Command Design Pattern. The Command Pattern separates the request for a particular action from the object that executes the action, providing a flexible way to handle various commands and actions without modifying the central control logic.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implementing this system using the Command Pattern:

Define a Command Interface:
Create a common interface Command that declares methods like execute() and undo().
python
Copy code
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
Create Concrete Command Classes:
Implement concrete command classes for each action that can be performed on a device (e.g., TurnOnCommand, TurnOffCommand, IncreaseTemperatureCommand, DecreaseVolumeCommand).
python
Copy code
class TurnOnCommand implements Command {
    private Device device;

    public TurnOnCommand(Device device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void execute() {
        device.turnOn();
    }

    public void undo() {
        device.turnOff();
    }
}

// Other concrete command classes (e.g., IncreaseTemperatureCommand, DecreaseVolumeCommand) follow a similar pattern.
Implement Devices:
Define device classes and their respective actions using methods like turnOn(), turnOff(), etc. Each device implements the Device interface, allowing them to be controlled by commands.
python
Copy code
interface Device {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
}

class Light implements Device {
    // Implement turnOn() and turnOff() for lights.
}

class Thermostat implements Device {
    // Implement turnOn() and turnOff() for thermostat.
}

class MusicPlayer implements Device {
    // Implement turnOn() and turnOff() for music player.
}
Implement the Invoker (Central Control):
Create a central control mechanism that can take high-level commands and execute them using the appropriate concrete command.
python
Copy code
class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }

    public void undoCommand() {
        command.undo();
    }
}
Integration and Usage:
When integrating a new device, create a new concrete command class for the device's actions, and implement the Device interface for the device. Then, register the command in the central control hub.
By utilizing the Command Pattern, the central control logic doesn't need to understand the internal workings of each device. Adding a new device involves creating a new concrete command class and implementing the device interface without modifying existing code, ensuring seamless integration. The RemoteControl class can then execute commands for any registered device, providing a unified and flexible control mechanism for the smart home automation system.
